  "oldNoticeTitle": "Surcharge due to potato shortage",
  "oldNoticeBody": "There is currently a shortage of chipping potatoes in the UK and it has meant that the price of these potatoes have increased significantly in recent weeks. <br></br> They have now reached a level that is well beyond the usual expected price range, which we normally absorb, and we need to increase the price of portions of chips to compensate.<br></br> Since we only expect the shortage to last until the new crop of potatoes are ready to be harvested this year, we are introducing a temporary surcharge on chips. and when the price of potatoes comes back into the expected range, the surcharge will end.<br></br> The surcharge will be: 40p per portion of chips 30p per portion of small chips 20p per chip cone 30p will be added for each meal with chips or where you have the chips option Surcharges are only on chips. Other foods are not affected."
